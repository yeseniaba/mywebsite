	<p>I wrote this product overview for WePay. I wrote 100% of the content and worked with a product marketing manager to ensure accuracy.</p>

	<p>This is API documentation I created for WePay. I wrote 100% of the Notifications page by talking with API developers, reviewing files checked into the engineering repository, and playing with Postman requests/responses. The content was written in HTML and Markdown, and checked into GitHub.</p>
